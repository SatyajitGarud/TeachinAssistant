This project features an interactive AI-powered teaching assistant chatbot capable of understanding voice input of student queries in over 50 languages, using Whisper-1 model, which also removes background noise for clearer communication. This input is then processed by a LLM tailored to match specific Teaching assistant personalities, considering chat history and Topic knowledge stored in a vector database via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The result is a text response that ensures engaging interactions with Students
